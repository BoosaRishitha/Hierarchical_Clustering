# Hierarchical_Clustering

# project Title :
Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of Americam mall Mrket called as phonix mall, find out on the basis of clients requirements of dendrogram using scipy grpahics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy", to ace the no. of linkage of clustering to predict.

# Problem Statement :
The American finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.

As data science engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.

# Task-1 :
With the help of numpy library import the library and import the dataset.
# Task-2 :
Usin the dendrogram to find the optimum number of clusters.
# Task-3 :
Create a hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot library.

# Dendrogram :

# Conclusion :
According to the model building as the engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 as give highest number of linkage.

# Insights :
Cluster 1 contains(red) color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclidean distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 139ks.

Cluster 2 contains(blue) color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclidean distance from the centroid upto annual income approximately 79-80ks.

Cluster 3 contains(green) color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclidean distance from the centroid upto annual income approximately 139ks.

Cluster 4 contains(blue) color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclidean distance from the centroid upto annual income approximately 39-40ks.

Cluster 5 contains(violet) color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclidean distance from the centroid upto annual income approximately 40-41ks.
